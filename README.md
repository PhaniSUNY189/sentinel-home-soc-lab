# üõ°Ô∏è Microsoft Sentinel 2025 ‚Äì Home SOC Lab

This project simulates a **Home Security Operations Center (SOC)** using **Microsoft Azure** and **Microsoft Sentinel**. Built entirely from scratch, the lab captures real attack data by exposing a honeypot VM to the public internet, forwarding logs to Sentinel, enriching them with geolocation data, and visualizing global attacker activity.

## üß† Key Learning Objectives

| Concept                         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel)        | Configure, monitor, and investigate incidents in a cloud-native SIEM        |
| Azure Infrastructure             | Deployed VM, NSG, VNet, LAW, and Sentinel from scratch                      |
| Log Forwarding & AMA             | Connected VMs to Log Analytics Workspace using Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)    |
| Kusto Query Language (KQL)       | Queried failed login logs and joined data with GeoIP watchlist              |
| Watchlist + Enrichment           | Merged IP logs with geolocation CSV for better insight                      |
| Visualization with Workbooks     | Created a live heatmap showing attacker geographies in real time            |

## üèóÔ∏è Lab Architecture Overview

1. **Azure VM Honeypot** (Windows 10)
2. **Network Security Group** ‚Äì all inbound traffic allowed
3. **Firewall disabled** ‚Äì logs all attack attempts
4. **Event Viewer** ‚Äì confirms failed login logs (Event ID 4625)
5. **Log Analytics Workspace** ‚Äì central repository for logs
6. **Microsoft Sentinel** ‚Äì SIEM setup for detection and queries
7. **GeoIP Watchlist** ‚Äì uploaded CSV for IP-to-location mapping
8. **Sentinel Workbook** ‚Äì interactive global map of attacker origins

## üîç Example KQL Query Used

```kusto
let geo = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| lookup kind=leftouter geo on $left.IPAddress == $right.Network
| project TimeGenerated, Account, IPAddress, CityName, CountryName, Latitude, Longitude
```
